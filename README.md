# Trail Manager
Trail Manager was developed as a project for CSC316 - Data Structures and Algorithms at North Carolina State University in Spring 2025. All classes were designed and implemented by myself. Data structures were designed by teaching staff and implemented by myself and imported as a library.

Trail Manager is a command line interface application that manages trail and landmark data and calculates reachable landmarks and number of intersecting trails. 

## How it Works
Trail and Landmark data can be imported as a .csv file that is then parsed and stored as a map with landmarks their corresponding trail lists as key-value pairs. Two functions are availabile to analyze the trail data. List Potential Locations for First Aid Stations allows a user to enter a minimum number of intersecting trails and lists all eligible trails in descending order by number of intersecting trails. View Distances to All Reachable Landmarks allows a user to enter a landmark ID and list all other landmarks that can be reached by trail from the starting landmark. 

## Technologies
This project was developed using the following:

-Java

-JUnit5
